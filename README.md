# i5-cybergame
A wargame simulation made by the i5 cyber element, with inspiration from the i5 intel element.


Compile with https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/

Earth + and all satellites will use the node system

The full screen menu will be accessed from Earth, and will have several tabs that correlate to each SFSC (Ops, Acquisitions, Cyber, etc.)

Menus:
- New window? Or just stick with the one screen?
- showing the upgrades for each satellite on the main screen would be cool

Zoom animation ideas:
- Zoom in so far the node fills the screen, then zoom out to see everything
- Zoom in as normal, then have all child nodes fly out

General:
- There is a layered group built-in to pygame. That might be useful at some point
- Use elliptical orbits
