# i5-cybergame
A wargame simulation made by the i5 cyber element, with inspiration from the i5 intel element.


Compile with https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/

Earth + and all satellites will use the node system

Ops/Personnel will use a rectangular menu: left side is slide menu, right is description

Acquisition will use a similar system to Ops/Personnel + three tabs on top (bases, satellites, tech). This will be how the player unlocks new upgrades/satellites/ranks/basically everything

Menus:
- New window? Or just stick with the one screen?

Zoom animation ideas:
- Zoom in so far the node fills the screen, then zoom out to see everything
- Zoom in as normal, then have all child nodes fly out
