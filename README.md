### Menus:
- New window? Or just stick with the one screen?
- showing the purchased upgrades for each satellite on the main screen would be cool

### Zoom animation ideas:
- Zoom in so far the node fills the screen, then zoom out to see everything
- Zoom in as normal, then have all child nodes fly out

### General:
- There is a layered group built-in to pygame. That might be useful at some point
- Use elliptical orbits
- `pyg.Surface.fill()` is hardware accelerated. Maybe switch?
- Compile with [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/)

### Todo list:
- Move node menus to the HUD class
